# Create Commit

Create a commit with auto-generated message from staged changes.

**Arguments**: `$ARGUMENTS` (optional commit message override)

## Instructions

1. Check for staged changes:
   - Run `git diff --cached --stat` to see staged files summary
   - If no staged changes, inform the user and suggest `git add`

2. Gather information about staged changes:
   - Run `git diff --cached` to see the actual diff
   - Run `git status` to see overall status

3. Generate commit message:
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the commit message
   - Otherwise, analyze the diff to generate:
     - **First line**: Short summary (50 chars max) in imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature", "Fix bug", "Update config")
     - **Body** (if needed): 2-3 sentence explanation of why the change was made

4. Create the commit using:
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<short summary>

<optional 2-3 sentence explanation>
EOF
)"
```

5. Show the commit result with `git log -1 --oneline`

## Examples
- `/commit` - Auto-generate commit message from staged changes
- `/commit "Fix typo in README"` - Use provided message

## Important
- Use imperative mood: "Add" not "Added", "Fix" not "Fixed"
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Don't commit if there are no staged changes
- Warn if committing sensitive files (.env, credentials, etc.)
